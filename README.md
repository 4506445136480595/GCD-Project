run_analysis.R
--------------
R script to merge UCI HAR test and training datasets. Download the [raw data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), extract and place in a folder called ```UCI HAR Dataset``` under the working directory. The script creates and writes a tidy data file summarising statistics (mean and standard deviation) by subject and activity type in the [Human Activity Recognition](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) database.

CodeBook.md
